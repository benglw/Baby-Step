Read to your toddler daily.
Ask her to find objects for you or name body parts and objects.
Play matching games with your toddler, like shape sorting and simple puzzles.
Encourage him to explore and try new things.
Help to develop your toddler’s language by talking with her and adding to words she starts. For example, if your toddler says “baba”, you can respond, “Yes, you are right―that is a bottle.”
Encourage your child’s growing independence by letting him help with dressing himself and feeding himself.
Respond to wanted behaviors more than you punish unwanted behaviors (use only very brief time outs). Always tell or show your child what she should do instead.
Encourage your toddler’s curiosity and ability to recognize common objects by taking field trips together to the park or going on a bus ride.
